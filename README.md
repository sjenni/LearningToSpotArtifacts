# Self-Supervised Feature Learning by Learning to Spot Artifacts [[Project Page]](https://sjenni.github.io/LearningToSpotArtifacts/) 

This repository contains demo code of our CVPR2018 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05024) . It contains code for unsupervised training on the unlabeled training set of STL-10 and code for supervised finetuning and evaluation on the labeled datasets. 

## Requirements
The code is based on Python 2.7 and tensorflow 1.8. See requirements.txt for all required packages.
